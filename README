Data2any::Xml version 0.0.1
===========================

DESCRIPTION

    The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on how
    to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for example C
    compilers and installed libraries) and any other information that should be
    provided before the module is installed.

    A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
    file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive can use
    it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a good idea to provide
    version information here so that people can decide whether fixes for the
    module are worth downloading.
